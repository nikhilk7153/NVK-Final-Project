0,"The chilaquiles were so good.
The tacos were convincing and taste verh similar to the real thing.

The arroz con Leche was taste and coconutty

The red velvet tasted awful like fridge or something. It wasn't good at all. Dry too.

I'd come back to again."
1,"As I embark in a new chapter of my life in which I am drastically forced to change my eating habits, I stumble upon this gem! Vegetarian, Vegan Authentic Mexican food! Wow! I'm beyond thrilled!  Did I say WOW?!
The masa for the tamales is so delicious who needs other ingredients!!  I gave up pork over 15 years ago & have missed eating tacos Al pastor, WOW! Never again! The seasoning was perfect!
I'm so looking forward to trying everything on their menu!  Can't wait to go back!"
2,"Absolutely delicious. I’m a flight attendant and eat vegan food all over the country. This spot is TOP notch. So yummy, big portions, amazing service, fair prices. I’m gonna be back here so often. Wow"
3,"A great variety of mex favorites with healthier substitutions. The staff was friendly and had answers to all my questions. Very well air conditioned, clean and tidy. I’m excited to return, the aguas frescas are divine! Thanks for a great first time."
4,"Absolutely delicious! I don't always enjoy eating vegan, but this place was great. I had two steak tacos that the girl at the register recommended, and a digestive smoothie. I was worried about the smoothie just because I wasn't sure how it would taste, but I got it with orange juice and I loved it! The two tacos were amazing and hit the spot. Thank you ladies!"
5,"Great place not only to come and workout but also to relax and unwind. This is my second year with them and I have nothing but nice things to say about it. Its never packed, super clean, latest equipment, very helpful staff. Many daily activities. Safe and friendly atmosphere. Lots of families come in. The list goes on and on. The cost of a yearly membership is above average, but when you see all you get and how you feel afterwards, you forget about everything. Highly recommend."
6,"Been coming here for 3 weeks now, great gym.
Nice and clean. I like the people who come here, everyone has been very friendly. A lot of equipment to use, areas to workout, and the classes are awesome. Tabatha is great and the hot yoga is killer."
7,This gym has everything you need and more to try out. The staff have been nothing but kind and respectful. The price seems cheap compared to how many amenities you get!
8,"Place is great! Lots of included free work out classes, 7 pickle ball courts, full bball court, tons of spacing and every piece of work out equipment you need. Filtered water, yoga classes as well, jacuzzi, pool. This place is Lifetime fitness for half the price. Always clean and everyone is very nice and respectful."
9,"New found love for swimming because of their new warm water outdoor pool with fun meal menu ( fish tacos, pizza, avocado toast, beer, wine, smoothies, etc. ) and indoor hot water therapy pool! Nice gym also."
10,The Field Museum is a must-see attraction. We spent about five hours here and we sped through a decent amount of the exhibits. There’s nothing that I can say here that will prepare you for the pure size of this place. So many exhibits just keep going and going. We had the City Pass which got us into all of the exhibits. We had a quick bite to eat at the cafe. There are a lot of vending machines and drinks available throughout. Wear comfy shoes because you will walk a lot!
11,It was an amazing trip! We paid out of state fees and we paid for all the special exhibitions. It was worth it. It took us all day to be able to get through the whole place and all the exhibitions. Chairs or benches available in every room. Stairs and elevators are available as well. Restrooms are super clean and you can find them near every area or exhibition. You can bring your own food and they have a few big cafeteria areas inside and outside to enjoy your break. Parking is not very close; we walked a few blocks to be able to get to the first available parking lot and paid $25 all day (not so bad for a Chicago parking space!). It is a great place to visit with kids or without kids.
12,"I hadn't been since I was a child, but we decided to take the kids. It was wonderful. Great exhibits. We actually didn't finish it before the kids got tired and restless. We definitely plan to go back and look again! Literally amazing for adults too!!!! Not just children. The dinosaurs were our personal favorites."
13,"Visited with the city pass/go city and my group of 16 Girl Scouts. Definitely go when the doors open at 9:00 to visit exhibits and beat the crowds. You can easily spend 2 days here soaking up all the information and displays... we spent 4 hours and saw the top must sees per our girls.

Wild Color exhibit was a hit and I highly recommend adding it to your visit when you get your tickets.

There were teen volunteers who did a great job with stations around the museum quizzing people and giving information/activities a bit more in depth.

Bathrooms were all very clean and the museum was spotless in regards to cleanliness.

They do have 2 nursing/pumping rooms for Moms that had a sink, outlet, and comfy chair."
14,"What a treasure!!! Second time for me to visit as an adult, first time for my 8.5 yo. We spent ~ 2 hrs. Paid extra for ocean jurassic but an Illinois resident basic at $25 would be as good. Don't go on weekends or later in the day, it was a bit chaotic because they were setting up tables for an apparently huge event. All in all an amazing place to visit w kids! We will come back for sure. If you are visiting from outside state consider getting the city pass. Again the basic ticket is already getting you to a lot of exhibits. No need to purchase extras."
15,"We wanted a fun day in Chicago with a family of five, it was between the shed and the Museum of science and industry.. there are many discounts but none for families very sad. Wound up buying the membership as it was the most economical.. there are many great exhibits to look at. We were able to catch one of the 10 minute main shows,. would've been nice if they were a little longer. We had an enjoyable day. Will have to go back to get use out of our one year annual pass now."
16,"I went here with my family during the week and it was timed entry, which helped with the crowds earlier in the day. We spent a little over 3 hours there and by the early afternoon, it was pretty crowded. We saw all the attractions (no movie or shows), ate lunch in the cafeteria and went to the gift shop. There were a lot of great photo opportunities and it looked like all of the exhibits were open. The cafeteria offers awesome views of the Chicago skyline too! My family and I had a great time!"
17,"A wide collection of species from all over the world. It is a bit smaller than other aquariums I've been to but it's activities really make up for it. There are a lot of interactive activities for families, couples, groups, and people going alone. Best time to go is about May- October which is when most, if not all, interactive touch the animal exhibits are open. Very expensive if you are either not a resident or if you decide to go on a regular price day. Check the calendar before planning your trip so you don't miss out on the discounted/free days. Once you get there definitely check out the animal meet-n-greets (which are often free) or the aquatic mammal shows put on by the trainers. The 4D experience is alright, but to be honest not very much worth the price. It's about 15 min long and plays out like a documentary. You get 3D glasses but they're not very good quality and they also use the same pair on multiple crowds. Not much goes on and if you're expecting to get splashed with water, it's mostly just bubbles. As a chicago native I would always recommend this to someone visiting but just be prepared to spend a good amount."
18,Really awesome aquarium with lots to explore. The dolphin show is fun even for adults. It can take a while to get through if you want to stop for every exhibit. 2-3 hours for casual aquarium goer; 4-5 hours for super aquarium lovers. You will not be able to do the aquarium and museum in one day if you really want to appreciate everything.
19,"It's a great place to visit but I feel it has lost its charm from the past. Kids friendly, easy to navigate, great 4D show and the food is good.. Some new additions as well to the residents of the museum in the last few years.
Parking and walking into the museum is a hassle but you got to deal with it."
20,"Poor customer experience and treatment received by banker Connie Walksler. I was expecting a warm, professional environment and it was definitely the contrary. This specific banker needs more training on wire transfers to Mexico especially, the lack of knowledge made me feel unsure about my transaction and business. She eventually helped me with this transfer but I left feeling not confident and uncomfortable."
21,"Because I'm unable to rate the company as a whole, I have no choice but to choose a location.  This is what I think of your transaction fees in relation to Venmo.  Go figure it out with them instead of dinging the customer $10 every time.  I'm leaving Venmo and I'm leaving you."
22,"Beautiful but there’s usually construction. There’s currently construction on the Clark entrance. However, they added ATMs on Clark just north of the original entrance.

There’s street parking with meters but they’re usually occupied. There is a cafe in the basement with a lot of different food options. It can get a little pricey but not too much for downtown prices. You can get anything from soup and salad to stir fry.

The bank itself is on the main floor. The staff is friendly and they always make sure to coordinate the customers to minimize wait times.

I needed new currency for Easter and this older gentleman was so helpful."
23,"Great service from Customer Service and banker Jon K.
Called ahead and got in contact with Customer Service immediately.  10 minutes later, dropped into the bank during the morning rush for a time-sensitive wire and was helped immediately, cordially, and professionally.  Thumbs up.  Not sure why it has bad reviews but guessing management has seen and is / has been correcting, because I have no complaints.
It's a huge branch location, too."
24,"It's wildly hilarious that the Chase Promenade in Millennium Park - just a few blocks from here - is named for this bank. This company claims to care about outdoor spaces and the Great Lakes, while also being the NUMBER ONE financial contributor to the climate crisis and the NUMBER ONE funder of tar sands pipelines, which threaten the Great Lakes."
25,"The university has a modern and big campus. Famous singers and comedians go to their arena to perform there and it’s for free if you study there! There’s a lot of things there. There’s a bank, Amazon, and a lot of restaurants. We had lunch there. There were a lot of choices to choose from. It was good and two students talked to us about how it is there. I really like this university and I might go there."
26,First time here and I loved it. The facility is so clean and the staff are so kind and understanding. The parking was easy but it was early my appointment but there is a parking garage near by. But surprised by the cleanliness because I am a neat freak and I loved it. Awesome 👍🏼😍
27,"Place is not good. No help for the freshmen at all. You go there and you are just lost. No one tells you anything. They didn't even tell you you needed to waive the medical insurance if you had one, otherwise it was automatic. Horrible environment as well. Every class has corny presentations that you need to do MOSTLY once a week. Not to mention, its a total rip off. Price has skyrocketed over the past years. College ain't it."
28,"I LOVE UIC! Great Campus! It’s so beautiful and they have wonderful programs.

I also hear they have a pretty Hot Computer nerd that works in VCAS, heard he’s a wiz a fixing almost everything; printers, computers, phones, projectors, cameras, etc. Wonder if he makes house calls."
29,I did not take a photo of the UIC building yet. I just shared a picture of the building next to UIC.
30,"I go to chipotle frequently and this time was the worst ever, no joke. Look at the pictures. We had a party and I ordered 4 entrees for 4 people. Party was over really quick. All 4 spent evening sh**ing themselves. The guacamole colour says it all with over burnt meat."
31,Reviewing after multiple poor experiences here. Pick up order is always either cold (even though I arrive early) or flat out wrong. Couldn’t get over my “cheese quesadilla” today and had to post
32,"This location is terrible. They give you anything when you do a pickup order. If you wait in line, they give the smallest portion size, barely any meat and not even a tablespoon of guacamole for the extra $3. Ridiculous!"
33,I eat Chipotle at several locations mostly on North side and I know what it should taste like as I always get the same meal. This location good was gross and is uneatable. The staff also did not properly close my steak bowl and on the walk back to work it leaked and stained my pants! I strongly advise that you avoid this location and head a block north inside Ogalvee train station and get burrito Beach.
34,"Just had a horrible experience with a woman named Lucille, who said she was the manager. I shop here all the time and never had any issues. I was pointing through the glass at toppings that I wanted, and she, very rudely yelled, “can you step away from the glass”! What?

I never touched the glass and never intended to. When I asked her what the issue was, she just rolled her eyes and said, don’t touch the glass!

Then the “GM” JC? Came over to talk to me and explain that her manager’s behavior was due to people previously touching the glass. Not sure what this had to do with me, but will never shop here again!"
35,They moved one door down into a completely brand new space. It’s brighter and more updated. The working space also feels cleaner. Glad they’re back after a long renovation hiatus! Same great team as before.
36,"I tried their newer location on 10/8/22 sometime in the later part of the afternoon. The place was bigger and more staff from the lasts time I visited with the older and much smaller location before. The staff was friendly and fast, the food was set up properly, cleanliness with plenty of meat to spare. Plus, I lucked out, one of the customers in line gave me a coupon for two footlong Subs for $12.99."
37,Subway is the healthiest and greatest deal I've had in Chicago NIH National Institute of Health recommends for one to eat 40% of their diet should be fruits and vegetables one Subway alone 6 in easily takes care of that requirement I like the deal bogo 50 buy one get one 50% off 2 ft longs for under $15 how could you beat that plus 175 points when you a amass 200 points it's $2 less at the cashier how could you beat that I'll always be a Subway fan cuz I have a voracious appetite
38,"It was open, and I was hungry. That gets one stars. I was saved by what I realized was the manager, as she'd ask me a question, and then turn to another employee while I was answering,turn back to me and ask the same question again. She just walked away after handing me my receipt with my sandwich still on her side of the register. I reached over the register to get it and left. Another feature is the locked restroom which require a pin code to enter."
39,Whenever I've stopped here for food the people working here have been very rude and unhelpful to me. Every other Subway in the country that I have been to have had very friendly workers most of whom will go out of their way to strike up a conversation with me. Not this place though. The food tasted pretty good at least and the restaurant seemed clean. Something else that is not the restaurants fault was the other customers eating there had the look of hate in their eyes.
40,"Great lighting, was quiet inside considering the loud music from across the street. Easy parking on a weekday afternoon. Food came out fast and was a delight to try something new. Everything was amazing. Thank you to our waitress for a great visit. *There’s a respectable 20% gratuity automatically added to your bill. I love this idea. If you’ve never been in the food service industry, It’s hard to relate. But some folks don’t leave a tip or might leave change. & to be fair most don’t know how to tip."
41,"I wanted to love this place. Drove over 3 hours to get to it.
Parking in this area is terrible. $2.50 an hour to park on the street if you can find a spot.
Greeted by a woman that explains that there is a mandatory 20% tip.
Waited a while to place my order despite there only being only 3 other tables occupied. It was more important for my waiter to be complaining to another waiter than to bother waiting on me.
Several employees that just wander around with seemingly nothing to do.
Once the order was placed the food came super quick. The country fried steak did not taste fresh and was very tough, not the correct consistency. Flavor was ok.
All in the bill was $23 for country fried steak and water. Seems very pricey to me."
42,Love this place! Today we got the country fried steak and Cuban sandwich. Both were amazing. I love that they have a huge menu and everything is vegetarian and can be altered to be made vegan.
43,"This is a really amazing vegetarian restaurant/diner. I would give it 5 stars, but I am a bit spoiled coming from Los Angeles. I ordered the steak dish which was true to taste, however I felt it was a little too bland for me. The Thai wings were pretty tasty and I enjoyed them. I also thought that the chicken shawarma could have been better because the pita bread that came with it was pretty standard (very much store bought). However the Reuben saved the day because it was amazing! I would not really recommend the vegan cheesecake because it doesn't have the same flavor that you'd expect from cheesecake."
44,"Best vegan joint in town. Everything on the menu is vegan by default. They do have dairy cheese and actually egg add ons but that's it when it comes to non vegan things.

Their sour cream and ranch are soooo good can't even tell it's vegan. This place is great if your lactose intolerant. Dairy free sauces and cheeses and bread.

Also BEST SHAKES EVER!!!!!!

If you want comfort food and dinner style food that's vegan this is the place."
45,"Great Authentic Italian food, fresh homemade pastas and desserts. Branzino is amazing, veal Cutlet Milanese is superb. Great selection of italian and domestic wines, also good varieties of wines from the rest of the world. The ambiance is very relaxing and the decor is elegant."
46,Great service and delicious food. Very classy establishment. The soft shell crab and veal were so tender and the creme brulee was lovely. Highly recommend!
47,Very good ...the place has been updated and is much more welcoming than the old Parma. The food was excellent. Giorgio is a welcoming host.
48,Georgio and staff were excellent! Blake and Alexander did an excellent job of serving us with a wonderful meal and drinks. We will be back!
49,What a delicious meal. Outstanding ambience.  Ulysses took very good care of us. We will be back. Thank you
